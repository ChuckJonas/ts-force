# ts-force

a typescript client for connecting with salesforce APIs.  Currently meant to run on Visualforce and have "Access Token" passed in via global scope.

`npm install ts-force`

***NOTE: ts-force is still very experimental and will likely continue to under-go breaking refactors for sometime.  USE AT OWN RISK!***

## Usage

## Generate code

This library is intended to use with code generation.  Files can be generated using the following command:

`ts-force-gen --accessToken '123abc' --instanceUrl https://cs65.my.salesforce.com --sobs Account,Contact --outputFile ./src/generated/sobs.ts`

`--accessToken|-a`: access token to connect to tooling API wit
`--instanceUrl|-i`: host url of the org your connecting with
`--sobs|-s`: list of comma seperated sobs to generate classes for
`--outputFile|-o`: (Optional) where to save the output

Relational properties are only included for the object you add.

Decorators are used to determine how to map query responses and which fields we can send to which methods.

### extending generated classes

Obviously don't change the generated classes if possible unless you want to deal with "merge hell" when you need to regenerate.

Will add details on how to extend once I figure it out myself (mix-ins?).

### Configure Access Token

This will need to be injected in the visualforce page:

```html
 <script type="text/javascript">
        //rest details
        const __ACCESSTOKEN__ = '{!$Api.Session_ID}';
        const __RESTHOST__ = '';
    </script>
```

Then we need to pass it to `RestClient`.

```typescript
import {Rest, BaseConfig} from 'type-force';

//let typescript know we expect these on global scope
declare var __RESTHOST__ : string;
declare var __ACCESSTOKEN__ : string;

//set configurations
let config = new BaseConfig();
config.host = __RESTHOST__;
config.accessToken = __ACCESSTOKEN__;
//set static config on Rest
Rest.config = config;
```

`RestClient.accessToken`: used to authinicate to the API
`RestClient.host`: used to specify the host.  primarly used for dev enviorments. Leave blank/empty if running on Visualforce page

### Quering Records

Query record via a static method on each generated claass.

```typescript
let accs: Account[] = Account.retrieve('SELECT Id FROM Account');
```

#### Relationships
Both Parent & Child relationships are supported.  Returned objects are instances of `RestObject` and you can permform DML.

```typescript

let accs: Account[] = await Account.retrieve(
  `SELECT Id, Name, Website, Active__c, (SELECT Id, Name, Email, Parent_Object__r.Id, Parent_Object__r.Name FROM Contacts) FROM Account WHERE Id = '0010m000006vmwJ'`
);

let contact = records[0].Contacts[0];
contact.Name = 'new name';
await contact.update();
let parentObj = contact.Parent_Object__r;
parentObj.Account__c = records[0].Id;
await parentObj.update();
```

### Record DML

Each DML opporation is provided through the `RestObject` base class that each generated class implements.

```typescript
let acc = new Account();
acc.Name = 'John Doe';
await acc.insert();
acc.Name = 'Jane Doe';
await acc.update();
await acc.delete();
```

## todo

- move class `type` to decorator
- reactor `Rest` class to be more testable (statics are bad mmmk)
- add ability to remap properties from API names
- add bulk API support
- add RemoteAction support
- Add ability for `ts-force-gen` to run from DX or meta-data package context
- figure out how to configure `ts-force-gen` to exclude/include meta-data at a more granular level
- deal with case sensitivity issue in query
- Most robost authinication configuration (oAuth?)
